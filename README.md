# Purpose

This repo is intended to coordinate Ethereum Berlin events

# Workflow

Talk proposals are added via issues (with the label `proposed talk`)
There is a milestone for each meetup and adding a `proposed talk` issue to this milestone means we want this talk at that meetup
We aim for 3-4 talks per meetup

# Timeline

 * init: select a concrete date for the next event
 * 2-3 weeks before the event:
   * contact presenters on shortlist (see all issues of the milestone for the event)
   * organize camera / cameraman
   * define moderator
 * 1 week pew event: 
   * finalize and confirm with speakers
   * announce on twitter/meetup
 * at the event
   * make sure audio is recorded at the source
 * 1day..1week after the event
   * publish videos
